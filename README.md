# Algorithms in Python

## Maximum_subarray
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return 
its sum.

Example:

Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

## Merge sort of lists
Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Example:

Input: 1->2->4, 1->3->4
Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4

## N_unique_int
Given an integer n, return any array containing n unique integers such that they add up to 0.

 

Example :

Input: n = 5
Output: [-7,-1,1,3,4]
Explanation: These arrays also are accepted [-5,-1,1,2,3] , [-3,-1,2,-2,4].

## Unique_paths
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

Example :

Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right
